# B2B Cart & Shipping System Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive B2B cart and shipping system for the Solar Shop Angular application. This system is designed specifically for B2B partner companies with company-specific pricing, pre-populated company information, and B2B-specific workflows.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components

### 1. **B2B Cart System**

#### **Models** (`src/app/features/b2b/cart/models/b2b-cart.model.ts`)
- `B2BCartItem`: Extended cart item with B2B-specific properties
  - Company and partner pricing
  - Retail price comparison and savings calculation
  - Minimum order quantities
  - Company-specific pricing flags
- `B2BCartState`: NgRx state management structure
- `B2BShippingInfo`: B2B-specific shipping information with company details

#### **NgRx Store Implementation**
- **Actions** (`store/b2b-cart.actions.ts`): Complete CRUD operations for cart management
- **Reducer** (`store/b2b-cart.reducer.ts`): State management with automatic totals calculation
- **Selectors** (`store/b2b-cart.selectors.ts`): Comprehensive selectors including:
  - Cart summary with tax/shipping calculations
  - Savings breakdown
  - Category-based filtering
  - Product-specific pricing information
- **Effects** (`store/b2b-cart.effects.ts`): Side effects with toast notifications and auto-sync

#### **Service** (`services/b2b-cart.service.ts`)
- Local storage-based persistence (company-specific)
- Mock API simulation with realistic B2B pricing
- Company-specific cart separation
- Automatic pricing calculations

  - Real-time cart updates
  - Quantity controls
  - Savings display
  - Company information display
  - Checkout integration

### 2. **B2B Shipping System**

#### **B2B Shipping Component** (`src/app/features/b2b/shared/components/b2b-shipping/`)
- **Pre-populated Company Information**: 
  - Company name, email, phone (read-only/disabled)
  - Auto-populated from authenticated user's company
- **Contact Person Details**:
  - Pre-filled with current user information
  - Editable contact person details
- **Delivery Address Management**:
  - Separate delivery address from company address
  - Country selection (Balkan region focus)
  - Postal code and city validation
- **Shipping Method Selection**:
  - Standard shipping (5-7 business days)
  - Express and scheduled delivery options
  - Dynamic pricing based on order value
- **B2B-Specific Features**:

  - Company account integration

## üåê Translation System Integration

### Croatian Translations (`hr`)
```typescript
b2bCart: {
  title: 'B2B Ko≈°arica',
  emptyTitle: 'Va≈°a ko≈°arica je prazna',
  emptyMessage: 'Dodajte proizvode u ko≈°aricu da biste nastavili s narud≈æbom',
  orderingFor: 'Naruƒçujete za',
  totalSavings: 'Ukupna u≈°teda',
  // ... and 15+ more keys
}

b2bShipping: {
  title: 'Informacije o dostavi',
  companyInformation: 'Informacije o tvrtki',
  deliveryAddress: 'Adresa dostave',
  shippingMethod: 'Naƒçin dostave',
  // ... and 15+ more keys
}
```

### English Translations (`en`)
- Complete English equivalents for all Croatian translations
- Consistent terminology across B2B and B2C systems
- Professional business language for B2B context

## üîó Integration Points

### 1. **Partners Products Component Integration**

- Proper error handling for unauthenticated users

### 2. **Existing B2C Shipping Enhancement**
- Updated `shipping.component.ts` to pre-populate email for authenticated users
- Disabled email field when user is logged in
- Maintains consistency between B2B and B2C user experience

### 3. **Contact Form Enhancement**
- Enhanced `partners-contact.component.ts` for product pricing inquiries
- Pre-fills product information from quote requests
- Automatic message generation for product quotes

## üíæ State Management

### NgRx Store Structure
```typescript
interface B2BCartState {
  items: B2BCartItem[];
